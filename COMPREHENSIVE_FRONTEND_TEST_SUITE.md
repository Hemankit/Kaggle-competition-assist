## üí° PRO TIPS

1. **Copy-paste batches**: Don't type manually, copy from this doc
2. **Check agent names**: Look at `agents_used` field first
3. **Watch for patterns**: Each agent has distinct response style
4. **Note the fixes**: Queries 22-23 test the agents we just fixed
5. **Screenshot wins**: Save screenshots of good responses for LinkedIn!

**Ready? Start with Batch 1 and work through all 10 batches!** üéâ
