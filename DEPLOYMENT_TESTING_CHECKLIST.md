# üß™ Deployment Testing Checklist
## Ensuring Deployed Version = Local Version

---

## üìã Pre-Deployment Verification

### 1. Local Environment Check
```bash
# On your local machine, test these queries and record responses

# Start local backend
python minimal_backend.py

# Start local frontend (in another terminal)
streamlit run streamlit_frontend/app.py

# Test these queries:
1. "What is the evaluation metric for Titanic?"
2. "Give me ideas for Titanic competition"
3. "Review my code: df['target_mean'] = df['target'].mean()"
```

**Record Results:**
- [ ] Query 1 response time: _____ seconds
- [ ] Query 2 response time: _____ seconds  
- [ ] Query 3 detects data leakage: YES / NO
- [ ] ChromaDB cache working: YES / NO
- [ ] All agents responding: YES / NO

---

## üöÄ Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Connect to EC2
```bash
# Replace with your actual key and IP
chmod 400 your-key.pem
ssh -i your-key.pem ubuntu@YOUR-EC2-IP
```

**Verification:**
- [ ] Successfully connected to EC2 instance

---

### Step 2: Run Deployment Script
```bash
# On EC2 instance
cd /home/ubuntu
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/YOUR-USERNAME/Kaggle-competition-assist/main/deployment_script.sh
chmod +x deployment_script.sh
./deployment_script.sh
```

---

### Step 3: Configure Environment Variables

```bash
cd /home/ubuntu/Kaggle-competition-assist
nano .env
```

**Copy these from your local .env:**
```env
ENVIRONMENT=production
KAGGLE_USERNAME=your-kaggle-username
KAGGLE_KEY=your-kaggle-api-key

- [ ] Frontend service created: `sudo systemctl status kaggle-frontend`
- [ ] Nginx running: `sudo systemctl status nginx`
- [ ] All services "active (running)" - no errors

---

### Step 5: Check Service Logs

```bash
# Check for errors in backend
sudo journalctl -u kaggle-backend -n 50

# Check for errors in frontend  
sudo journalctl -u kaggle-frontend -n 50

# Check Nginx errors
sudo tail -n 50 /var/log/nginx/error.log
```

**Verification:**
- [ ] No "ERROR" messages in backend logs
- [ ] No "ERROR" messages in frontend logs
- [ ] No critical errors in Nginx logs
- [ ] Backend shows "Running on http://0.0.0.0:5000"
- [ ] Frontend shows "You can now view your Streamlit app"

## üêõ Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Issue 1: Services Not Starting

```bash
# Check detailed logs
sudo journalctl -u kaggle-backend -n 100 --no-pager
sudo journalctl -u kaggle-frontend -n 100 --no-pager

# Common fixes:
# 1. Missing dependencies
cd /home/ubuntu/Kaggle-competition-assist
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 2. Port already in use
sudo netstat -tulpn | grep :5000
sudo netstat -tulpn | grep :8501

# 3. Permission issues
sudo chown -R ubuntu:ubuntu /home/ubuntu/Kaggle-competition-assist
```

---

### Issue 2: Frontend Loads but Can't Connect to Backend

```bash
# Check Nginx configuration
sudo nginx -t
sudo cat /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/kaggle-copilot

# Check backend is running
curl http://localhost:5000/health

# Check firewall (AWS Security Group)
# Ensure ports 80, 443, 5000, 8501 are open
```

---

### Issue 3: Slow Response Times

```bash
# Check EC2 instance resources
htop  # Install if needed: sudo apt install htop

# Check memory
free -h

# Check disk space
df -h

# Add swap if low memory
sudo fallocate -l 2G /swapfile
sudo chmod 600 /swapfile
sudo mkswap /swapfile
sudo swapon /swapfile
```

---

### Issue 4: Playwright/Scraping Errors

```bash
# Reinstall Playwright with dependencies
cd /home/ubuntu/Kaggle-competition-assist
source venv/bin/activate
playwright install --with-deps

# Check browser binaries
playwright install --help
```

---

---

## üìû Support

If you encounter issues:

1. **Check logs first:**
   ```bash
   sudo journalctl -u kaggle-backend -f
   sudo journalctl -u kaggle-frontend -f
   ```

2. **Common commands:**
   ```bash
   # Restart services
   sudo systemctl restart kaggle-backend kaggle-frontend
   
   # Check status
   sudo systemctl status kaggle-backend
   
   # View configuration
   cat /etc/systemd/system/kaggle-backend.service
   ```

3. **Debug mode:**
   Edit `.env` and add:
   ```
   DEBUG=True
   FLASK_DEBUG=True
   ```
   Then restart: `sudo systemctl restart kaggle-backend`

---

## üìä Performance Monitoring

### Set up CloudWatch (Optional)

```bash
# Install CloudWatch agent
wget https://s3.amazonaws.com/amazoncloudwatch-agent/ubuntu/amd64/latest/amazon-cloudwatch-agent.deb
sudo dpkg -i amazon-cloudwatch-agent.deb
```

### Monitor logs in real-time

```bash
# Terminal 1: Backend logs
sudo journalctl -u kaggle-backend -f

# Terminal 2: Frontend logs  
sudo journalctl -u kaggle-frontend -f

# Terminal 3: Nginx logs
sudo tail -f /var/log/nginx/access.log
```

---

**üöÄ Once all checks pass, your deployed version is working exactly like local!**

**Next steps:**
1. Share the URL with testers
2. Monitor logs for first 24 hours
3. Gather feedback
4. Iterate and improve
