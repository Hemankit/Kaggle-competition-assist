Query 10: Review my code:
```python
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier

X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2)
model = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100)
model.fit(X_train, y_train)
score = model.score(X_test, y_test)
print(f'Accuracy: {score}')
```

Query 11: Check this code for issues:
```python
data = pd.read_csv('data.csv')
model = RandomForestClassifier()
model.fit(data.drop('target', axis=1), data['target'])
predictions = model.predict(test_data)
```

Query 12: Optimize my feature engineering:
```python
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
scaler = StandardScaler()
X_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(X)
model = LogisticRegression()
model.fit(X_scaled, y)
```

VALIDATION: Should see code_feedback_agent, detailed review, NOT "Received query:"

================================================================================
BATCH 5: ERROR DIAGNOSIS (ErrorDiagnosisAgent)
================================================================================

Query 13: I'm getting this error: ValueError: Found array with 0 samples
Query 14: TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len()
Query 15: MemoryError: Unable to allocate memory when training

VALIDATION: Should see error_diagnosis_agent, root cause analysis, solutions

BATCH 6: DISCUSSIONS (DiscussionHelperAgent)
================================================================================

Query 16: What's the community discussing about feature engineering?
Query 17: Show me discussion about data preprocessing
Query 18: Are there any discussions about overfitting?

VALIDATION: Should see discussion_helper_agent, actual discussion threads

BATCH 7: IDEAS (IdeaInitiatorAgent) - JUST VERIFIED!
================================================================================

Query 19: Give me ideas for improving my score
Query 20: What approaches should I try?
Query 21: Suggest a starting approach

VALIDATION: Should see idea_initiator_agent, 3-5 ideas with expected scores

================================================================================
BATCH 8: TIMELINE & PROGRESS - JUST FIXED!
================================================================================

Query 22: Am I stagnating?
VALIDATION: Should see timeline_coach_agent, NOT "Received query:" ‚Üê TESTS THE FIX!

Query 23: What should I try next?
VALIDATION: Should see multihop_reasoning_agent, NOT stub response ‚Üê TESTS THE FIX!

Query 24: Check my competition progress
VALIDATION: Should see progress_monitor_agent, progress analysis

Query 25: How should I structure my timeline?
VALIDATION: Should see timeline_coach_agent, phase breakdown

================================================================================
BATCH 9: COMMUNITY FEEDBACK (CommunityEngagementAgent)
================================================================================

Query 26: I posted in the feature engineering thread and got suggestions to use PCA
Query 27: Community suggested trying XGBoost instead of Random Forest
Query 28: What should I do with the feedback I got?

VALIDATION: Should see community_engagement_agent, strategy from feedback

================================================================================
BATCH 10: COMPLEX ORCHESTRATION
================================================================================

Query 29: I'm getting low accuracy. The evaluation metric is accuracy. What should I do?
VALIDATION: Multi-agent response, strategic recommendation

Query 30: Review this code for overfitting:
```python
model = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=500, max_depth=100)
model.fit(X_train, y_train)
train_score = model.score(X_train, y_train)
test_score = model.score(X_test, y_test)
```
And I got this error: warning: RandomForestClassifier is overfitting
VALIDATION: Combines code review + error diagnosis

Query 31: Based on top notebooks and discussions, what's the best approach?
VALIDATION: Should see multihop_reasoning_agent, synthesis from sources

================================================================================
‚úÖ VALIDATION CHECKLIST (Check EACH response)
================================================================================

For each query response verify:
‚òê agents_used field shows SPECIFIC agent (NOT fallback_agent)
‚òê confidence score is 0.95 (not 0.5 or 0.6)
‚òê system field says "multi-agent" (not "fallback")
‚òê Response is 50+ words of real advice
‚òê NO "Received query:" echoing
‚òê NO stub/placeholder text
‚òê NO error stack traces

================================================================================
üü¢ SUCCESS CRITERIA
================================================================================

GO FOR LINKEDIN IF:
‚úÖ 25+ queries tested
‚úÖ ZERO fallback_agent responses
‚úÖ All responses are real (not stubs)
‚úÖ Confidence scores are 0.95
‚úÖ Queries 22-23 (the FIXES) work perfectly
‚úÖ Frontend renders cleanly
‚úÖ No timeout errors

================================================================================
‚ö° QUICK STATS TO TRACK
================================================================================

Total queries: 31
Queries with code blocks: 4
Queries testing FIXED agents: 2 (Queries 22 & 23)
Expected time: ~30 minutes
Success threshold: 30/31 queries working = GO FOR LINKEDIN! üöÄ
