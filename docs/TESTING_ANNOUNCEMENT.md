### **Version 1: Call for Testers**

### **Version 2: Show & Tell**

```
🤖 I built an AI that beats ChatGPT for Kaggle. Here's proof.

I asked ChatGPT: "Help me with Titanic competition"
→ Got 10 generic tips (try XGBoost, engineer features, etc.)

I asked MY tool the SAME question:
→ Got 5 specific Titanic ideas based on actual competition data

The difference? My tool:
✅ Knows the actual competition
✅ Tracks your submissions
✅ Remembers community feedback
✅ Returns detailed answers in 1-2s (15x faster!)

🧪 **Want to test it?**
Takes 5 minutes. You try 3 queries and tell me:
• Did it beat ChatGPT?
• Was the cache fast enough?
• Would you use it for real competitions?

📖 **Test guide:** [LINK]
🚀 **Live demo:** [LINK]

Comment "Testing!" and I'll send you the link.

First 20 testers get early access + feature in credits! 🎯

### **Version 3: Problem-Solution**

```
❌ Problem: ChatGPT forgets my Kaggle competition context every time.

I have to explain:
• Which competition I'm in
• What I've already tried
• What my current score is
• What feedback I got from the community

EVERY. SINGLE. TIME.

✅ Solution: I built a tool that REMEMBERS.

It knows:
✓ Your competition
✓ Your progress
✓ Your submissions
✓ Community feedback you received
✓ What you've already tried

Plus it's 15x faster on repeat queries (25s → 1.5s!)

🧪 **I need testers:**
• 5 minutes of your time
• Try 3 queries
• Compare to ChatGPT
• Tell me what you think

🎁 Early testers get:
• Free lifetime access
• Feature in Hall of Fame
• Shape the roadmap
