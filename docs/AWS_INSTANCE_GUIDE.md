## 💡 **Will t3.micro Handle Your Tool?**

**Yes! Here's why:**

### **Your System Requirements:**
- Flask backend (lightweight) ✅
- Streamlit frontend (moderate) ✅
- LLM API calls (external, no local resources) ✅
- ChromaDB (lightweight vector DB) ✅
- Smart cache (reduces compute load) ✅

### **t3.micro Resources:**
- 2 vCPU → Handles Flask + Streamlit easily
- 1 GB RAM → Sufficient with your smart cache
- Burstable CPU → Perfect for agent orchestration spikes

### **What Might Be Slow:**
- First-time scraping (but that's expected)
- Heavy concurrent traffic (50+ users at once)
- Large ChromaDB queries (but rare)

**Solution:** Your smart cache solves most of this! Repeat queries are 15x faster.
