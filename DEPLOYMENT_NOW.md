## üî¥ CRITICAL: DO THIS FIRST (30 seconds)

### Update GitHub Username in Deployment Scripts

**You need to replace `YOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME` in 2 files:**

1. Open `deployment_script.sh`
2. Find line 44: `git clone https://github.com/YOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME/...`
3. Replace `YOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME` with your actual GitHub username

**Quick fix command:**
```powershell
# Run this in PowerShell (adjust if your username is different)
# Replace YOUR_ACTUAL_GITHUB_USERNAME below

$username = "YOUR_ACTUAL_GITHUB_USERNAME"
(Get-Content deployment_script.sh) -replace 'YOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME', $username | Set-Content deployment_script.sh
```

---

## üìã 3-STEP DEPLOYMENT PROCESS

### STEP 1: Push to GitHub (2 minutes)

```powershell
cd C:\Users\heman\Kaggle-competition-assist

# Stage everything
git add .

# Commit
git commit -m "Production deployment ready - AWS automation complete"

# Push
git push origin main
```

**Verify:** Visit your GitHub repo and confirm the files are there.

---

### STEP 2: Run Automated Deployment on EC2 (20 minutes)

#### 2A. Connect to EC2

```powershell
# In PowerShell
cd C:\Users\heman\Downloads

# Fix key permissions
icacls "Key__2__Success.pem" /inheritance:r
icacls "Key__2__Success.pem" /grant:r "heman:(R)"

# Connect (replace YOUR-EC2-IP with actual IP from AWS Console)
ssh -i Key__2__Success.pem ubuntu@YOUR-EC2-IP
```

**Expected:** See `ubuntu@ip-xxx-xxx-xxx-xxx:~$`

---

#### 2B. Run Deployment Script

**On EC2 (copy-paste this):**
```bash
# Download script (replace YOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME!)
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/YOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME/Kaggle-competition-assist/main/deployment_script.sh

# Make executable
chmod +x deployment_script.sh

# Run
./deployment_script.sh
```

**This installs (automatic - just wait ~15 min):**
- ‚úÖ Python 3.11
- ‚úÖ Node.js 20
- ‚úÖ Nginx
- ‚úÖ All system dependencies
- ‚úÖ Playwright browsers
- ‚úÖ Your entire project
- ‚úÖ All Python packages

---

#### 2C. Transfer .env File

**Option A: Automated (Recommended)**

**Open NEW PowerShell window on Windows:**
```powershell
cd C:\Users\heman\Kaggle-competition-assist
.\transfer_env_to_ec2.ps1
```

Follow prompts:
- Enter EC2 IP when asked
- Enter path to .pem key when asked
- Script automatically changes ENVIRONMENT to production

**Option B: Manual**

**On EC2:**
```bash
cd /home/ubuntu/Kaggle-competition-assist
nano .env
```

Copy your local `.env` content, but change:
```env
ENVIRONMENT=production  # ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: Must be "production"!
```

Save: `Ctrl+X`, `Y`, `Enter`

**Verify:**
```bash
cat .env | grep ENVIRONMENT
# Should show: ENVIRONMENT=production
```

---

#### 2D. Setup Services

**On EC2:**
```bash
cd /home/ubuntu/Kaggle-competition-assist

# Download service setup script (replace YOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME!)
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/YOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME/Kaggle-competition-assist/main/setup_services.sh

# Make executable
chmod +x setup_services.sh

# Run
./setup_services.sh
```

**Expected output:**
```
‚úÖ Setup complete!

üåê Your application is now running at:
   Frontend: http://YOUR-EC2-IP
   Backend Health: http://YOUR-EC2-IP/health
```

---

### STEP 3: Verify It Works (5 minutes)

#### Test 1: Health Check

**On EC2:**
```bash
curl http://localhost:5000/health
```

**Expected:**
```json
{"status": "healthy", "timestamp": "..."}
```

‚úÖ If you see this, backend is running!

---

#### Test 2: Frontend Access

**In your browser:**
```
http://YOUR-EC2-IP
```

**Expected:**
- Beautiful dark theme UI loads
- "Initialize Session" form visible
- No errors in browser console (F12)

‚úÖ If you see the UI, frontend is working!

---

#### Test 3: Full Functionality Test

**Critical Test - Do this to confirm deployment = local:**

1. **Initialize Session:**
   - Kaggle Username: `hemankit`
   - Competition: `titanic`
   - Click "üöÄ Initialize Session"
   - Wait ~10 seconds

2. **First Query:**
   ```
   What is the evaluation metric for Titanic?
   ```
   - Click Send
   - Wait 20-30 seconds (normal - complex multi-agent processing)
   - Should get intelligent response about accuracy/classification

3. **üî• THE CRITICAL TEST - Cache Speedup:**
   - Ask the **EXACT SAME QUESTION** again:
   ```
   What is the evaluation metric for Titanic?
   ```
   - **Should respond in 1-3 seconds!** üöÄ
   - **If this works, your cache is working = 15x speedup!**

4. **Code Review Test:**
   ```
   Review my code: df['target_mean'] = df['target'].mean()
   ```
   - Should detect data leakage
   - Should suggest using train data only
   - Quality should match local version

**If all 4 tests pass:**
```
üéâ DEPLOYMENT SUCCESSFUL! üéâ
Your Kaggle Competition Assistant is LIVE!
```

## üêõ IF SOMETHING GOES WRONG

### Issue: Services Not Starting

```bash
# Check what went wrong
sudo journalctl -u kaggle-backend -n 50 --no-pager

# Try restarting
cd /home/ubuntu/Kaggle-competition-assist
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
sudo systemctl restart kaggle-backend kaggle-frontend
```

### Issue: Frontend Can't Reach Backend

```bash
# Verify backend is actually running
curl http://localhost:5000/health

# Check .env exists and is correct
cat /home/ubuntu/Kaggle-competition-assist/.env | grep ENVIRONMENT

# Restart everything
sudo systemctl restart kaggle-backend kaggle-frontend nginx
```

### Issue: Memory Issues (t3.micro has only 1GB RAM)

```bash
# Add 2GB swap space
sudo fallocate -l 2G /swapfile
sudo chmod 600 /swapfile
sudo mkswap /swapfile
sudo swapon /swapfile
echo '/swapfile none swap sw 0 0' | sudo tee -a /etc/fstab

# Verify
free -h
```

### Issue: Playwright Errors

```bash
cd /home/ubuntu/Kaggle-competition-assist
source venv/bin/activate
playwright install --with-deps
sudo systemctl restart kaggle-backend
```
