# 🚀 EC2 Deployment Fix - README

## **YES, it IS possible to deploy this exactly like it works locally!**

The issue you're experiencing (placeholder responses) is a **common deployment problem** with a **simple fix**.

---

## 🎯 The Problem

Your app returns generic responses like:
```
Metric: Check competition description
```

Instead of actual competition data that it fetches locally.

---

## 💡 The Root Cause

**99% of the time, it's one of these:**

1. **Playwright browsers not installed** (most common!)
   - The Python package installs, but browser binaries don't
   - Web scraping fails silently
   - App returns placeholder data

2. **Missing or incorrect environment variables**
   - API keys not set on EC2
   - App can't authenticate with services

3. **Service configuration issues**
   - Services not restarting properly
   - Wrong Python version or virtual environment

---

## ✅ The Solution

I've created **automated scripts** to fix this:

### **Option 1: Automated Fix (Recommended)**

1. Upload the fix scripts to your EC2 instance:
   ```bash
   # On your local machine
   scp -i your-key.pem fix_ec2_deployment.sh ubuntu@YOUR-EC2-IP:/home/ubuntu/Kaggle-competition-assist/
   scp -i your-key.pem diagnose_deployment.sh ubuntu@YOUR-EC2-IP:/home/ubuntu/Kaggle-competition-assist/
   ```

2. SSH into EC2:
   ```bash
   ssh -i your-key.pem ubuntu@YOUR-EC2-IP
   ```

3. Run the fix:
   ```bash
   cd /home/ubuntu/Kaggle-competition-assist
   chmod +x fix_ec2_deployment.sh
   chmod +x diagnose_deployment.sh
   ./fix_ec2_deployment.sh
   ```

4. Wait 5-10 minutes (it will install everything needed)

5. Test it:
   - Open: `http://YOUR-EC2-IP`
   - Ask: "What is the evaluation metric for Titanic?"
   - You should now see **real competition data**! 🎉

### **Option 2: Quick Manual Fix**

If you just want to install Playwright browsers (the main issue):

```bash
ssh -i your-key.pem ubuntu@YOUR-EC2-IP
cd /home/ubuntu/Kaggle-competition-assist
source venv/bin/activate
playwright install --with-deps chromium
sudo systemctl restart kaggle-backend
```

Wait 30 seconds and test again.

## 🔍 Diagnostics

Not sure what's wrong? Run the diagnostic script:

```bash
cd /home/ubuntu/Kaggle-competition-assist
./diagnose_deployment.sh
```

This will:
- ✅ Check all dependencies
- ✅ Verify environment variables
- ✅ Test Python imports
- ✅ Validate services
- ✅ Test actual API calls
- ✅ Give specific recommendations

## 📁 Files Created

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `fix_ec2_deployment.sh` | Automated fix script - installs everything needed |
| `diagnose_deployment.sh` | Diagnostic tool - identifies exact issues |

## 🎯 What the Fix Script Does

The `fix_ec2_deployment.sh` script will:

1. ✅ Verify project directory and Python version
2. ✅ Create/update virtual environment
3. ✅ Install all Python dependencies
4. ✅ **Install Playwright browsers** (the critical fix!)
5. ✅ Verify environment variables (API keys)
6. ✅ Create required directories
7. ✅ Test all critical imports
8. ✅ Configure systemd services
9. ✅ Restart services properly
10. ✅ Configure Nginx reverse proxy
11. ✅ Test backend health endpoint
12. ✅ Run a functional test query

**Total time:** ~5-10 minutes

---

## 📊 Expected Results After Fix

### Performance
- **First query:** 20-30 seconds ✅ (scraping + LLM processing)
- **Cached query:** 1-3 seconds ✅ (15x speedup!)
- **All 10 agents working:** ✅
- **Code review working:** ✅
- **Ideas generation working:** ✅
- **Discussion scraping working:** ✅

### Response Quality
**Query:** "What is the evaluation metric for Titanic?"

**Before Fix ❌**
```
Metric: Check competition description
```

**After Fix ✅**
```
Metric: Classification Accuracy
This competition evaluates submissions based on accuracy - the percentage 
of passengers you correctly predict as surviving or not surviving.

Formula: (Number of Correct Predictions) / (Total Predictions)
```

## 🔄 If Fix Script Fails

1. **Check the output** - it will tell you what failed
2. **Look at the logs:**
   ```bash
   sudo journalctl -u kaggle-backend -n 100
   ```
3. **Common issues:**
   - Missing API keys → Edit `.env` file
   - Insufficient memory → Upgrade EC2 instance to t3.medium
   - Permission errors → Run: `sudo chown -R ubuntu:ubuntu /home/ubuntu/Kaggle-competition-assist`

4. **Run diagnostic:**
   ```bash
   ./diagnose_deployment.sh
   ```

5. **See detailed troubleshooting:**
   - `DEPLOYMENT_TROUBLESHOOTING.md` - comprehensive guide
   - `QUICK_FIX_GUIDE.md` - quick reference

## 🌟 Key Points

### It's NOT Impossible!
- ✅ Your app works perfectly locally
- ✅ It can work the same way on EC2
- ✅ The fix is usually simple (Playwright browsers)
- ✅ Automated scripts handle everything

### Why This Happens
- Playwright is a **2-part install**: Python package + browser binaries
- Most deployment guides forget the browser binaries
- Without them, scraping fails silently
- App falls back to placeholder responses

### The Fix Works Because
- Installs browser binaries with system dependencies
- Verifies all environment variables
- Restarts services with proper configuration
- Tests everything end-to-end

## 📞 Still Having Issues?

### Step 1: Run Diagnostics
```bash
./diagnose_deployment.sh > diagnosis.txt
cat diagnosis.txt
```

### Step 2: Check Logs
```bash
sudo journalctl -u kaggle-backend -n 100 > backend_logs.txt
cat backend_logs.txt
```

### Step 3: Provide Details
If you need help, include:
- Output from diagnostic script
- Backend logs (last 100 lines)
- EC2 instance type (t2.micro, t3.medium, etc.)
- Any specific error messages

---

## 🎉 Success Criteria

Your deployment is working correctly when:

1. ✅ Health check returns `{"status": "healthy"}`
2. ✅ Query about metrics returns actual competition data
3. ✅ Cached queries are 15x faster than first query
4. ✅ No errors in backend logs
5. ✅ All agents respond correctly
6. ✅ Code review detects issues (test: "Review my code: df['target_mean'] = df['target'].mean()")
7. ✅ Ideas generation provides competition-specific suggestions
