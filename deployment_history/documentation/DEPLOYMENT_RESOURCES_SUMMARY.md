## 🔧 What the Deployment Does

### `deployment_script.sh`
1. Updates system packages
2. Installs Python 3.11
3. Installs Node.js 20
4. Installs Nginx
5. Installs system dependencies for Playwright
6. Clones your repository
7. Creates virtual environment
8. Installs Python packages
9. Installs Playwright browsers

**Time:** ~10 minutes

### `setup_services.sh`
1. Creates backend systemd service
2. Creates frontend systemd service
3. Configures Nginx reverse proxy
4. Enables auto-start on boot
5. Starts all services
6. Verifies services are running

**Time:** ~2 minutes

---

## 🎯 Success Criteria

Your deployment is successful when:

### Functionality ✅
- [ ] Health endpoint responds
- [ ] Frontend loads in browser
- [ ] Queries return intelligent responses
- [ ] Cache speedup working (15x)
- [ ] All 10 agents working

### Performance ✅
- [ ] First query: 20-30s
- [ ] Cached query: 1-3s
- [ ] Frontend loads: <2s
- [ ] No timeout errors

### Quality ✅
- [ ] Response quality = local version
- [ ] Code review detects issues
- [ ] Ideas generation works
- [ ] Discussion scraping works

## 🔍 Critical Configuration Changes

### 1. Backend URL (Fixed!)
**Before:**
```python
BACKEND_URL = "http://localhost:5000"  # Hardcoded
```

**After:**
```python
BACKEND_URL = os.getenv("BACKEND_URL", "http://localhost:5000")  # Configurable
```

This allows the frontend to work in both development and production.

### 2. Environment Variable
Your `.env` must have:
```env
ENVIRONMENT=production  # NOT development!
```

This ensures:
- Groq is used (not Ollama which requires local GPU)
- Production optimizations enabled
- Proper error handling

## 📊 Architecture Overview

```
User Browser
    ↓
Nginx (Port 80)
    ↓
┌─────────────────┬──────────────┐
│  Frontend       │  Backend     │
│  (Streamlit)    │  (Flask)     │
│  Port 8501      │  Port 5000   │
└─────────────────┴──────────────┘
         ↓                ↓
    ChromaDB          Kaggle API
    (Cache)           (Data)
```

**How it works:**
1. Nginx receives all traffic on port 80
2. Routes `/` to Streamlit frontend (8501)
3. Routes `/api/*` to Flask backend (5000)
4. Both services auto-restart on failure
5. ChromaDB provides 15x cache speedup

## 🐛 Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue 1: Scripts Not Found on EC2
**Problem:** wget fails with 404

**Solution:**
```bash
# Make sure you pushed to GitHub first!
cd C:\Users\heman\Kaggle-competition-assist  # Local machine
git push origin main

# Then verify on GitHub
# Visit: https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/Kaggle-competition-assist
```

### Issue 2: .env Not Configured
**Problem:** Backend fails to start

**Solution:**
```bash
# Verify .env exists
cat /home/ubuntu/Kaggle-competition-assist/.env

# Check ENVIRONMENT is production
grep ENVIRONMENT /home/ubuntu/Kaggle-competition-assist/.env
```

### Issue 3: Services Won't Start
**Problem:** systemctl status shows "failed"

**Solution:**
```bash
# Check detailed logs
sudo journalctl -u kaggle-backend -n 100

# Usually: missing dependencies
cd /home/ubuntu/Kaggle-competition-assist
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
sudo systemctl restart kaggle-backend
```

### Issue 4: Frontend Loads But Queries Fail
**Problem:** Frontend shows errors on query

**Solution:**
```bash
# Verify backend is running
curl http://localhost:5000/health

# Check backend logs
sudo journalctl -u kaggle-backend -f

# Restart backend
sudo systemctl restart kaggle-backend
```

## 📈 Performance Comparison

| Metric | Expected (Local) | Expected (EC2) | Acceptable? |
|--------|------------------|----------------|-------------|
| First query | 20-30s | 20-30s | ✅ Same |
| Cached query | 1-3s | 1-3s | ✅ Same |
| Frontend load | <2s | <2s | ✅ Same |
| Code review | Detects issues | Detects issues | ✅ Same |
| Ideas quality | Specific ideas | Specific ideas | ✅ Same |

**Target:** All metrics should be within 10% of local version

## 🔒 Security Considerations

After deployment works:

1. **Restrict SSH Access**
   - AWS Console → Security Groups
   - Change SSH (22) from `0.0.0.0/0` to your IP

2. **Monitor Costs**
   - Set up billing alert at $10/month
   - t3.micro is FREE (750 hours/month)

3. **Backup ChromaDB**
   - Set up daily backups
   - Store in AWS S3 or locally

4. **Update Regularly**
   ```bash
   cd /home/ubuntu/Kaggle-competition-assist
   git pull origin main
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   sudo systemctl restart kaggle-backend kaggle-frontend
   ```
