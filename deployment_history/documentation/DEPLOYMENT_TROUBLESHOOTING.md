# üîß Deployment Troubleshooting Guide

## Problem: Deployed App Returns Placeholder Responses

### Symptom
When you ask "What is the evaluation metric?" for a competition, you get:
```
Metric: Check competition description
Evaluation Details: Check the competition page for detailed evaluation criteria.
```

Instead of actual competition data like:
```
Metric: Accuracy
This competition uses classification accuracy to evaluate submissions...
```

## Root Causes & Solutions

### üéØ Most Common Issue: Playwright Browsers Not Installed

**Why this happens:**
- Playwright requires browser binaries (Chromium, Firefox, WebKit)
- Installing the Python package alone is NOT enough
- Without browsers, web scraping fails silently
- The app returns placeholder data instead of scraped data

**How to fix:**
```bash
# SSH into your EC2 instance
ssh -i your-key.pem ubuntu@YOUR-EC2-IP

# Navigate to project
cd /home/ubuntu/Kaggle-competition-assist

# Activate virtual environment
source venv/bin/activate

# Install Playwright browsers (CRITICAL!)
playwright install --with-deps chromium

# Restart backend service
sudo systemctl restart kaggle-backend

# Wait 30 seconds for service to fully restart
sleep 30

# Test it
curl http://localhost:5000/health
```

**Verification:**
```bash
# Check if Playwright is working
playwright --version

# Should output: Version 1.41.0 (or similar)
```

---

## üöÄ Quick Fix: Automated Script

We've created a comprehensive fix script that addresses all common issues:

```bash
# On your EC2 instance
cd /home/ubuntu/Kaggle-competition-assist

# Make scripts executable
chmod +x fix_ec2_deployment.sh
chmod +x diagnose_deployment.sh

# First, diagnose the issue
./diagnose_deployment.sh

# Then run the automated fix
./fix_ec2_deployment.sh
```

The fix script will:
1. ‚úÖ Reinstall all Python dependencies
2. ‚úÖ Install Playwright browsers with system dependencies
3. ‚úÖ Verify environment variables
4. ‚úÖ Create required directories
5. ‚úÖ Restart services with proper configuration
6. ‚úÖ Test backend health endpoint

---

## üîç Diagnostic Checklist

Run through this checklist to identify the exact issue:

### 1. Check if Backend is Running
```bash
sudo systemctl status kaggle-backend
```

**Expected:** `Active: active (running)`
**If not running:**
```bash
sudo systemctl start kaggle-backend
sudo journalctl -u kaggle-backend -n 50
```

### 2. Check Backend Logs for Errors
```bash
sudo journalctl -u kaggle-backend -n 100 | grep -i error
```

**Common errors to look for:**
- `playwright._impl._api_types.Error: Executable doesn't exist` ‚Üí Playwright browsers not installed
- `ModuleNotFoundError` ‚Üí Missing Python dependencies
- `API key not found` ‚Üí Environment variables not set
- `Permission denied` ‚Üí File permissions issue

### 3. Test Backend Health
```bash
curl http://localhost:5000/health
```

**Expected response:**
```json
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "timestamp": "2025-10-15T...",
  "version": "1.0.0"
}
```

### 4. Check Environment Variables
```bash
cat /home/ubuntu/Kaggle-competition-assist/.env | grep -E "KAGGLE|GROQ|GOOGLE"
```

**Must have:**
- `KAGGLE_USERNAME` (not placeholder)
- `KAGGLE_KEY` (not placeholder)
- `GROQ_API_KEY` (not placeholder)
- `GOOGLE_API_KEY` (not placeholder)
- `ENVIRONMENT=production`

### 5. Verify Python Dependencies
```bash
cd /home/ubuntu/Kaggle-competition-assist
source venv/bin/activate
python -c "import playwright; print('Playwright OK')"
python -c "from orchestrators.component_orchestrator import ComponentOrchestrator; print('Orchestrator OK')"
python -c "from RAG_pipeline_chromadb.rag_pipeline import ChromaDBRAGPipeline; print('ChromaDB OK')"
```

All should print "OK" without errors.

### 6. Test Playwright Browsers
```bash
source venv/bin/activate
playwright --version
```

**If command not found or error:**
```bash
pip install playwright
playwright install --with-deps chromium
```

### 7. Check Port Accessibility
```bash
netstat -tuln | grep -E '5000|8501'
```

**Should show:**
- Port 5000 (backend) LISTENING
- Port 8501 (frontend) LISTENING

### 8. Test Actual Query
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/session/new \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"query": "What is the evaluation metric?", "competition_slug": "titanic", "user_id": "test"}' \
  --max-time 30
```

**If you see "Check competition description"** ‚Üí Main issue confirmed
**If you see actual accuracy/metrics data** ‚Üí Working correctly!

## üêõ Common Issues & Fixes

### Issue 1: Playwright Executable Missing
**Error in logs:**
```
playwright._impl._api_types.Error: Executable doesn't exist at /home/ubuntu/.cache/ms-playwright/chromium-1097/chrome-linux/chrome
```

**Fix:**
```bash
cd /home/ubuntu/Kaggle-competition-assist
source venv/bin/activate
playwright install --with-deps chromium
sudo systemctl restart kaggle-backend
```

---

### Issue 2: Missing Environment Variables
**Symptom:** Backend starts but returns generic errors

**Fix:**
```bash
# Edit .env file
nano /home/ubuntu/Kaggle-competition-assist/.env

# Add your actual API keys:
ENVIRONMENT=production
KAGGLE_USERNAME=your-actual-username
KAGGLE_KEY=your-actual-key
GROQ_API_KEY=your-groq-key
GOOGLE_API_KEY=your-google-key
DEEPSEEK_API_KEY=your-deepseek-key
HUGGINGFACEHUB_API_TOKEN=your-hf-token

# Save and restart
sudo systemctl restart kaggle-backend
```

---

### Issue 3: Services Not Starting
**Check logs:**
```bash
sudo journalctl -u kaggle-backend -n 100 --no-pager
```

**Common fixes:**

**a) Port already in use:**
```bash
# Find process using port 5000
sudo netstat -tulpn | grep :5000
# Kill it if needed
sudo kill <PID>
# Restart service
sudo systemctl start kaggle-backend
```

**b) Permission issues:**
```bash
# Fix ownership
sudo chown -R ubuntu:ubuntu /home/ubuntu/Kaggle-competition-assist
# Restart
sudo systemctl restart kaggle-backend
```

**c) Missing dependencies:**
```bash
cd /home/ubuntu/Kaggle-competition-assist
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
sudo systemctl restart kaggle-backend
```

---

### Issue 4: Slow or Timeout Responses
**Symptom:** First query takes >60 seconds or times out

**Causes:**
1. EC2 instance too small (needs at least t3.medium)
2. Scraping taking too long
3. LLM API rate limits

**Fixes:**
```bash
# 1. Add swap memory (if instance has <4GB RAM)
sudo fallocate -l 2G /swapfile
sudo chmod 600 /swapfile
sudo mkswap /swapfile
sudo swapon /swapfile

# 2. Check instance resources
htop
free -h
df -h

# 3. Upgrade to larger instance if needed (t3.medium recommended)
```

---

### Issue 5: ChromaDB Cache Not Working
**Symptom:** Queries always slow, no speedup on repeated queries

**Check ChromaDB:**
```bash
ls -la /home/ubuntu/Kaggle-competition-assist/chroma_db/
```

**Should contain:**
- `chroma.sqlite3` file
- UUID directories with data

**Fix:**
```bash
# Ensure directory exists and has correct permissions
mkdir -p /home/ubuntu/Kaggle-competition-assist/chroma_db
chmod -R 755 /home/ubuntu/Kaggle-competition-assist/chroma_db

# Restart backend
sudo systemctl restart kaggle-backend
```

---

### Issue 6: Frontend Loads but Can't Connect to Backend
**Symptom:** Frontend UI loads but queries fail with "Network Error"

**Check Nginx configuration:**
```bash
sudo nginx -t
sudo cat /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/kaggle-copilot
```

**Ensure proxy_pass is correct:**
```nginx
location /api/ {
    proxy_pass http://localhost:5000/;
    ...
}
```

**Restart Nginx:**
```bash
sudo systemctl restart nginx
```

**Check backend is reachable:**
```bash
curl http://localhost:5000/health
```

---

## üìä Performance Expectations

### First Query (No Cache)
- **Time:** 20-30 seconds
- **Why:** Scraping competition page + LLM processing
- **Normal behavior:** This is expected for cold starts

### Cached Query (Same question)
- **Time:** 1-3 seconds
- **Why:** Data retrieved from ChromaDB cache
- **Speedup:** ~15x faster! üöÄ

### If Different from Above
- First query >60s ‚Üí Instance too small or missing dependencies
- Cached query >10s ‚Üí ChromaDB not working or not activated

## üéØ Verification: Working vs Not Working

### ‚úÖ WORKING (What you should see)

**Query:** "What is the evaluation metric for Titanic?"

**Response:**
```
üìä Evaluation Metric for titanic

üéØ How Your Submission Will Be Scored:

Metric: Classification Accuracy
This competition evaluates submissions based on accuracy - the percentage 
of passengers you correctly predict as surviving or not surviving.

Formula: (Number of Correct Predictions) / (Total Predictions)

üìã Evaluation Details:
Your submission file should contain exactly 418 entries plus a header row.
Each entry should predict 0 (did not survive) or 1 (survived).
```

### ‚ùå NOT WORKING (Placeholder response)

**Query:** "What is the evaluation metric for Titanic?"

**Response:**
```
üìä Evaluation Metric for titanic

üéØ How Your Submission Will Be Scored:

Metric: Check competition description
Competition: titanic
Category: Not specified
Deadline: Not specified

üìã Evaluation Details: Check the competition page for detailed evaluation criteria.
```

**If you see the second response ‚Üí Scraping is not working!**
