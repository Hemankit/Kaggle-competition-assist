## ✅ Solution (5 Minutes)

### Step 1: Connect to EC2
```bash
ssh -i your-key.pem ubuntu@YOUR-EC2-IP
```

### Step 2: Run Fix Script
```bash
cd /home/ubuntu/Kaggle-competition-assist
chmod +x fix_ec2_deployment.sh
./fix_ec2_deployment.sh
```

**The script will:**
- ✅ Install Playwright browsers (main issue!)
- ✅ Verify all dependencies
- ✅ Check environment variables
- ✅ Restart services properly

### Step 3: Wait & Test
```bash
# Wait 30 seconds for services to restart
sleep 30

# Test
curl http://localhost:5000/health
```

### Step 4: Verify in Browser
Open: `http://YOUR-EC2-IP`

Ask: "What is the evaluation metric for Titanic?"

**You should now see real data!** 🎉

## 🐛 Manual Fix (If Script Fails)

### Most Common Issue: Playwright Browsers
```bash
cd /home/ubuntu/Kaggle-competition-assist
source venv/bin/activate
playwright install --with-deps chromium
sudo systemctl restart kaggle-backend
```

### Second Most Common: Missing API Keys
```bash
nano /home/ubuntu/Kaggle-competition-assist/.env
```

**Add your actual keys:**
```env
ENVIRONMENT=production
KAGGLE_USERNAME=your-username
KAGGLE_KEY=your-api-key
GROQ_API_KEY=your-groq-key
GOOGLE_API_KEY=your-google-key
```

Save and restart:
```bash
sudo systemctl restart kaggle-backend
```
