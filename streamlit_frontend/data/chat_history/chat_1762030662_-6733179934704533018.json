      "content": "Hello! Here are the key facts about this competition:\n\n### 1. Core Information\n\n*   **Objective**: The goal is to predict whether a passenger survived the sinking of the Titanic.\n*   **Output**: For each passenger in the test set, participants must predict a binary value (0 for deceased, 1 for survived) for the `Survived` variable.\n\n### 2. Data Context\n\n*   **Data Split**: The data is divided into a `train.csv` (training set) and a `test.csv` (test set).\n    *   The training set includes the ground truth (`survival` outcome) for each passenger and is used to build machine learning models.\n    *   The test set does not include the ground truth; predictions are required for these passengers.\n*   **Features**: The available features for each passenger include:\n    *   `pclass`: Ticket class (1st, 2nd, 3rd â€“ a proxy for socio-economic status).\n    *   `sex`: Sex.\n    *   `Age`: Age in years (can be fractional or estimated as xx.5).\n    *   `sibsp`: Number of siblings/spouses aboard.\n    *   `parch`: Number of parents/children aboard.\n    *   `ticket`: Ticket number.\n    *   `fare`: Passenger fare.\n    *   `cabin`: Cabin number.\n    *   `embarked`: Port of Embarkation (C = Cherbourg, Q = Queenstown, S = Southampton).\n*   **Target Variable**: `survival` (0 = No, 1 = Yes).\n*   **Test Set Size**: The submission file requires exactly 418 entries, indicating the size of the test set.\n\n### 3. Evaluation Details\n\n*   **Metric**: The competition uses **accuracy** as its evaluation metric.\n*   **Measurement**: Your score is the percentage of passengers for whom you correctly predict survival.\n\n### 4. Competition Type\n\n*   **Task**: This is a **binary classification** problem, as the objective is to predict one of two discrete outcomes (survived or not survived).\n*   **Data Structure**: The data is structured, presented in tabular CSV files.\n\n### 5. Key Constraints\n\n*   **Submission File Format**:\n    *   Must be a CSV file.\n    *   Must contain exactly 418 entries plus a header row.\n    *   Must have exactly two columns: `PassengerId` and `Survived`.\n    *   The `Survived` column must contain binary predictions (1 for survived, 0 for deceased).\n    *   `PassengerId` can be sorted in any order.\n*   **Example Submission**: An example submission file, `gender_submission.csv`, is provided on the Data page to illustrate the required format.\n*   **Deadlines**: No specific deadlines are mentioned in the provided information.",
