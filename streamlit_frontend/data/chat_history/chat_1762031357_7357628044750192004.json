To give you the most accurate and practical advice, I need to know which specific metric your competition is using!\n\nPlease tell me:\n\n*   **Metric Name:** (e.g., RMSE, F1-score, LogLoss, MAE, Accuracy, AUC, etc.)\n*   **Any specific details or variations:** (e.g., \"F1-score for the positive class,\" \"RMSE on log-transformed targets,\" \"Macro F1,\" \"Weighted F1\")\n\nOnce you provide the metric, I'll break down exactly how it works, how to optimize for it, and what preprocessing steps will give you an edge!",
