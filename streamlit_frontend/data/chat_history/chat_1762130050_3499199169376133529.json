      "content": "Hello! Here is a factual overview of the competition based on the provided information:\n\n### Competition Overview: Unknown Competition\n\n1.  **Core Information**:\n    *   **About**: This competition involves predicting the survival status of passengers aboard the Titanic.\n    *   **Objective**: For each passenger in the test set, participants must predict whether they survived (1) or did not survive (0) the sinking.\n\n2.  **Data Context**:\n    *   **Files Provided**: `train.csv`, `test.csv`, and `gender_submission.csv`.\n    *   **Training Data (`train.csv`)**: Contains features and the survival outcome (ground truth) for each passenger, used for building machine learning models.\n    *   **Test Data (`test.csv`)**: Contains features for passengers, but without the survival outcome. This set is used to evaluate model performance on unseen data.\n    *   **Example Submission (`gender_submission.csv`)**: An example file demonstrating the required submission format, which assumes all female passengers survive and others do not.\n    *   **Key Features (Variables)**:\n        *   `survival`: The target variable (0 = No, 1 = Yes).\n        *   `pclass`: Ticket class (1st, 2nd, 3rd), serving as a proxy for socio-economic status.\n        *   `sex`: Gender of the passenger.\n        *   `Age`: Age in years (can be fractional or estimated as xx.5).\n        *   `sibsp`: Number of siblings or spouses aboard.\n        *   `parch`: Number of parents or children aboard (0 if only with a nanny).\n        *   `ticket`: Ticket number.\n        *   `fare`: Passenger fare.\n        *   `cabin`: Cabin number.\n        *   `embarked`: Port of Embarkation (C = Cherbourg, Q = Queenstown, S = Southampton).\n\n3.  **Evaluation Details**:\n    *   **Metric**: The competition uses **accuracy** as its scoring metric.\n    *   **Measurement**: Accuracy is calculated as the percentage of passengers for whom the survival prediction is correct.\n\n4.  **Competition Type**:\n    *   This is a **binary classification** task, as the objective is to predict one of two outcomes (survived or not survived).\n    *   The data provided is **structured/tabular**.\n\n5.  **Key Constraints**:\n    *   **Submission File Format**:\n        *   Must be a CSV file.\n        *   Must contain exactly 418 entries plus a header row.\n        *   Must have exactly two columns: `PassengerId` (can be sorted in any order) and `Survived`.\n        *   The `Survived` column must contain binary predictions (1 for survived, 0 for deceased).\n        *   Submissions with extra columns (beyond `PassengerId` and `Survived`) or rows will result in an error.\n    *   **Example**: An example submission file (`gender_submission.csv`) is available for download on the Data page.",
