      "content": "Here are the key facts about this Kaggle competition:\n\n### 1. Core Information\n\n*   **Competition Focus**: This competition centers on predicting the survival outcome of passengers aboard the Titanic.\n*   **Objective**: The primary goal is to predict, for each passenger in the test set, whether they survived (1) or did not survive (0) the sinking of the Titanic.\n\n### 2. Data Context\n\n*   **Data Type**: The competition uses structured, tabular data related to Titanic passengers.\n*   **Datasets Provided**:\n    *   `train.csv`: Contains features and the `Survived` outcome for building machine learning models.\n    *   `test.csv`: Contains features for which `Survived` outcomes must be predicted.\n    *   `gender_submission.csv`: An example submission file demonstrating the required format.\n*   **Data Volume**: The test set, for which predictions are required, consists of exactly 418 entries.\n*   **Key Features (Variables)**:\n    *   `pclass`: Ticket class (1st, 2nd, 3rd), a proxy for socio-economic status.\n    *   `sex`: Passenger's gender.\n    *   `Age`: Age in years (can be fractional or estimated as xx.5).\n    *   `sibsp`: Number of siblings or spouses aboard.\n    *   `parch`: Number of parents or children aboard.\n    *   `ticket`: Ticket number.\n    *   `fare`: Passenger fare.\n    *   `cabin`: Cabin number.\n    *   `embarked`: Port of Embarkation (Cherbourg, Queenstown, or Southampton).\n    *   `PassengerId`: Unique identifier for each passenger (used in submission).\n    *   `survival`: The target variable (0 = No, 1 = Yes).\n\n### 3. Evaluation Details\n\n*   **Metric**: The performance of submissions is measured using **accuracy**.\n*   **Success Measurement**: Your score represents the percentage of passengers for whom you correctly predict their survival status (0 or 1).\n\n### 4. Competition Type\n\n*   **Task Type**: This is a **binary classification** problem, as the goal is to predict one of two discrete outcomes (survived or not survived).\n*   **Data Structure**: The data is **structured**, presented in a tabular format with clearly defined columns.\n\n### 5. Key Constraints\n\n*   **Submission File Format**:\n    *   Must be a `.csv` file.\n    *   Must contain exactly 418 entries plus a header row.\n    *   Must have exactly two columns: `PassengerId` and `Survived`.\n    *   `PassengerId` can be in any order.\n    *   `Survived` column must contain binary predictions (1 for survived, 0 for deceased).\n*   **Deadlines**: No deadlines are specified in the provided information.",

      "content": "Hello! Here is a factual overview of the competition based on the information provided:\n\n### Competition Overview: Unknown Competition\n\n**1. Core Information:**\n*   **Objective:** The primary goal of this competition is to predict the survival outcome for passengers aboard the Titanic. Participants are required to build a machine learning model using provided training data and then use it to predict whether each passenger in the test set survived or not.\n\n**2. Data Context:**\n*   **Data Split:** The data is divided into a `training set (train.csv)` and a `test set (test.csv)`.\n*   **Files Provided:** `train.csv`, `test.csv`, and `gender_submission.csv`.\n*   **Training Data (`train.csv`):** Contains features for passengers along with their survival outcome (ground truth).\n*   **Test Data (`test.csv`):** Contains features for passengers, but the survival outcome is not provided; this is what needs to be predicted.\n*   **Example Submission (`gender_submission.csv`):** An example file showing the expected format for submissions, which assumes all female passengers survive and others do not.\n*   **Features/Columns:**\n    *   `survival`: Survival (0 = No, 1 = Yes) - *Outcome variable in training set, target for prediction in test set.*\n    *   `pclass`: Ticket class (1 = 1st/Upper, 2 = 2nd/Middle, 3 = 3rd/Lower) - *A proxy for socio-economic status.*\n    *   `sex`: Sex\n    *   `Age`: Age in years (fractional if less than 1, xx.5 if estimated).\n    *   `sibsp`: Number of siblings / spouses aboard the Titanic.\n    *   `parch`: Number of parents / children aboard the Titanic.\n    *   `ticket`: Ticket number.\n    *   `fare`: Passenger fare.\n    *   `cabin`: Cabin number.\n    *   `embarked`: Port of Embarkation (C = Cherbourg, Q = Queenstown, S = Southampton).\n\n**3. Evaluation Details:**\n*   The competition aims to measure how well a model performs on unseen data (`test.csv`).\n*   The specific evaluation metric (e.g., accuracy, F1-score, AUC) used to quantify \"how well\" a model performs is **not explicitly stated** in the provided information.\n\n**4. Competition Type:**\n*   **Task:** This is a **Binary Classification** task, as the objective is to predict one of two discrete outcomes: \"survived\" (1) or \"not survived\" (0).\n*   **Data Structure:** The data is **structured/tabular**, consisting of clearly defined columns and rows.\n\n**5. Key Constraints:**\n*   **Submission Format:** Submissions should follow the format of `gender_submission.csv`, which includes passenger identifiers and their predicted survival outcomes.\n*   **Deadlines/Special Rules:** No information regarding deadlines or specific competition rules (beyond the data usage and submission format) is provided in the given text.",
