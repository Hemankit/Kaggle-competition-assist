      "content": "Hello! Here is a factual overview of the competition based on the provided information:\n\n### Competition Overview: Unknown Competition\n\n**1. Core Information:**\n*   **Topic:** The competition focuses on predicting passenger survival during the sinking of the Titanic.\n*   **Objective:** Participants are tasked with predicting whether each passenger in the test set survived (1) or did not survive (0) the sinking. Models are built using a training set where the outcome (ground truth) is provided, and then applied to an unseen test set for prediction.\n\n**2. Data Context:**\n*   **Data Sets:** The data is split into `train.csv` (for model building, includes survival outcome) and `test.csv` (for making predictions, survival outcome is not provided). An example submission file, `gender_submission.csv`, is also available.\n*   **Features:** The dataset includes various features for each passenger:\n    *   `PassengerId`\n    *   `pclass`: Ticket class (1st = Upper, 2nd = Middle, 3rd = Lower, a proxy for socio-economic status).\n    *   `sex`: Gender.\n    *   `Age`: Age in years (fractional if less than 1, estimated ages are xx.5).\n    *   `sibsp`: Number of siblings or spouses aboard the Titanic.\n    *   `parch`: Number of parents or children aboard the Titanic (note: `parch=0` for children traveling only with a nanny).\n    *   `ticket`: Ticket number.\n    *   `fare`: Passenger fare.\n    *   `cabin`: Cabin number.\n    *   `embarked`: Port of Embarkation (C = Cherbourg, Q = Queenstown, S = Southampton).\n*   **Target Variable:** `survival` (0 = No, 1 = Yes).\n\n**3. Evaluation Details:**\n*   **Metric:** The primary evaluation metric is **accuracy**.\n*   **Measurement:** Your score represents the percentage of passengers for whom you correctly predict survival or non-survival.\n\n**4. Competition Type:**\n*   **Task:** This is a **binary classification** task, as the goal is to predict one of two discrete outcomes (survived or not survived).\n*   **Data Structure:** The data is structured, typically presented in a tabular format.\n\n**5. Key Constraints:**\n*   **Submission File Format:**\n    *   Submissions must be a CSV file.\n    *   The file must contain exactly 418 entries plus a header row.\n    *   It must have exactly two columns: `PassengerId` and `Survived`.\n    *   The `Survived` column should contain your binary predictions (1 for survived, 0 for deceased).\n    *   `PassengerId` can be sorted in any order.\n    *   Submissions with extra columns (beyond `PassengerId` and `Survived`) or rows will result in an error.\n*   **Example Submission:** An example submission file (`gender_submission.csv`) is provided to illustrate the required format.",
