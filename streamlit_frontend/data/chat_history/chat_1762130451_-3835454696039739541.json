      "content": "Here is a factual overview of the competition:\n\n### 1. Core Information\n\nThis competition focuses on predicting the survival outcome of passengers aboard the Titanic. The objective is to build a machine learning model using a provided training set to predict whether each passenger in a separate test set survived (1) or did not survive (0) the sinking.\n\n### 2. Data Context\n\n*   **Data Sets**: The competition provides three files:\n    *   `train.csv`: Used for building machine learning models, includes the ground truth (survival outcome) for each passenger.\n    *   `test.csv`: Used for evaluating model performance on unseen data; the ground truth for survival is not provided, and predictions for these passengers are required.\n    *   `gender_submission.csv`: An example submission file demonstrating the required format.\n*   **Features**: The data includes various features for each passenger, such as:\n    *   `PassengerId`\n    *   `pclass`: Ticket class (1st = Upper, 2nd = Middle, 3rd = Lower)\n    *   `sex`: Sex\n    *   `Age`: Age in years (fractional if less than 1, xx.5 if estimated)\n    *   `sibsp`: Number of siblings / spouses aboard\n    *   `parch`: Number of parents / children aboard\n    *   `ticket`: Ticket number\n    *   `fare`: Passenger fare\n    *   `cabin`: Cabin number\n    *   `embarked`: Port of Embarkation (C = Cherbourg, Q = Queenstown, S = Southampton)\n*   **Target Variable**: The variable to predict is `survival`, where 0 indicates no survival and 1 indicates survival.\n*   **Test Set Size**: The test set for which predictions are required contains exactly 418 entries.\n\n### 3. Evaluation Details\n\n*   **Metric**: Submissions are scored based on **accuracy**.\n*   **Measurement**: Accuracy is calculated as the percentage of passengers for whom the survival outcome is correctly predicted.\n\n### 4. Competition Type\n\nThis is a **binary classification** competition. The task involves predicting one of two discrete outcomes (survived or not survived) for each passenger. The data provided is structured (tabular).\n\n### 5. Key Constraints\n\n*   **Submission File Format**: Submissions must be a CSV file.\n*   **File Content**: The submission file must contain exactly 418 entries (rows) plus a header row.\n*   **Columns**: It must have exactly two columns: `PassengerId` and `Survived`.\n*   **`Survived` Column**: This column must contain binary predictions (1 for survived, 0 for deceased).\n*   **`PassengerId` Order**: The `PassengerId` column can be sorted in any order.\n*   **Errors**: Submissions with extra columns (beyond `PassengerId` and `Survived`) or extra rows will result in an error.\n*   **Example**: An example submission file (`gender_submission.csv`) is available for reference.",
