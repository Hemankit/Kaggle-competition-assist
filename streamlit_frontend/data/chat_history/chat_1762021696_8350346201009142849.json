Submissions with extra columns (beyond `PassengerId` and `Survived`) or rows will result in an error.\n    *   **Columns**: The file must have exactly two columns: `PassengerId` and `Survived`.\n    *   **`Survived` Column**: This column must contain the binary predictions (1 for survived, 0 for deceased).\n    *   **`PassengerId` Column**: The `PassengerId` column can be sorted in any order.\n    *   **Example Submission**: An example submission file (`gender_submission.csv`) is available for download on the Data page.\n    *   **Deadlines/Special Rules**: No information regarding deadlines or other special rules is provided in the text.\n\nHello there! Here's a factual overview of the competition based on the information provided:\n\n### Competition Overview:\n\n1.  **Core Information**:\n    *   **What it's about**: The competition involves predicting the survival outcome of passengers from the sinking of the Titanic.\n    *   **Objective**: To build a machine learning model that predicts, for each passenger in the test set, whether they survived or not.\n\n2.  **Data Context**:\n    *   **Data Split**: The data is divided into two main sets: `train.csv` (training set) and `test.csv` (test set).\n    *   **Training Set (`train.csv`)**: This set includes the \"ground truth\" (actual survival outcome) for each passenger and should be used to build machine learning models.\n    *   **Test Set (`test.csv`)**: This set does not include the ground truth. Participants are required to predict the survival outcomes for these passengers.\n    *   **Features**: Models will be based on features such as passengers' gender and class. Feature engineering is also encouraged to create new features.\n    *   **Example Submission**: A file named `gender_submission.csv` is provided as an example of the expected submission file format, demonstrating predictions based on the assumption that all female passengers survived and others did not.\n\n3.  **Evaluation Details**:\n    *   **Success Measurement**: Model performance is measured by how well it predicts outcomes on the unseen data in the `test.csv` set.\n    *   **Specific Metric**: The provided information does not explicitly state the evaluation metric (e.g., accuracy, F1-score, etc.) that will be used.\n\n4.  **Competition Type**:\n    *   **Task**: This is a **Binary Classification** task, as the objective is to predict one of two outcomes: \"survived\" or \"not survived.\"\n    *   **Data Type**: The data appears to be **Structured Data**, given the mention of CSV files and specific features like gender and class.\n\n5.  **Key Constraints**:\n    *   **Submission Format**: Submissions must follow a specific format, exemplified by `gender_submission.csv`, containing predictions for each passenger in the test set.\n    *   **Deadlines/Special Rules**: No specific deadlines or special rules are mentioned in the provided overview.\n\nHello there! Here's a factual overview of the competition based on the information provided:\n\n### Competition Information Summary\n\n1.  **Core Information**:\n    *   **Objective**: The competition requires participants to develop functionally correct Python programs for each of the 400 tasks within the ARC-AGI public training v1 benchmark suite.\n    *   **Goal**: To achieve the highest possible score by writing efficient and correct programs.\n\n2.  **Data Context**:\n    *   **Tasks**: There are 400 distinct tasks, originating from the ARC-AGI public training v1 benchmark suite.\n    *   **Task Nature**: Each task involves solving a problem that can be represented by `<input, output>` pairs, implying a need for programs that transform given inputs into expected outputs.\n    *   **Input/Output**: The specific nature of the `<input, output>` pairs is not detailed in this text, but it's the basis for evaluating program correctness.\n\n3.  **Evaluation Details**:\n    *   **Metric for Correct Programs**: A functionally correct program earns `max(1, 2500 - length)` points, where `length` refers to the number of characters (or bytes) in the program. This rewards shorter, correct programs.\n    *   **Metric for Incorrect Programs**: A functionally incorrect program (e.g., one that doesn't compile or fails for any `<input, output>` pair) earns `0.001` points.\n    *   **Total Score Utility**: The scoring system allows participants to infer the total number of program failures from their overall score.\n\n4.  **Competition Type**:\n    *   This is a **program synthesis/code generation** competition. Participants are required to write and submit executable code (Python programs) that solve specific tasks, rather than submitting predictions from a pre-trained model.\n    *   It focuses on the functional correctness and efficiency (program length) of the submitted code.\n\n5.  **Key Constraints**:\n    *   **Number of Tasks**: Solutions are required for 400 tasks.\n    *   **Submission File**: Submissions must be a single `.zip` file named `submission.zip`.\n    *   **Submission Content**: The `submission.zip` file must contain at most one Python file per task, named sequentially (e.g., `task001.py`, `task002.py`, ..., `task400.py`).\n    *   **Language**: Programs must be written in Python.\n    *   **Program Length**: The length (characters/bytes) of each submitted Python program directly impacts its score if correct, incentivizing concise solutions.\n\nHello there! Here's a factual overview of the competition based on the available information:\n\n### Competition Overview:\n\n1.  **Core Information**:\n    This competition is centered around predicting survival. The objective is to determine whether a passenger survived or not, likely in the context of the Titanic disaster given the feature descriptions.\n\n2.  **Data Context**:\n    The data provided is structured and tabular, containing information about individual passengers. Key features described include:\n    *   **`pclass`**: Represents the passenger's class, serving as a proxy for socio-economic status (SES). It has three categories: 1st (Upper), 2nd (Middle), and 3rd (Lower).\n    *   **`age`**: The passenger's age. Ages less than 1 are fractional. If an age is estimated, it is indicated in the format `xx.5`.\n    *   **`sibsp`**: The number of siblings or spouses traveling with the passenger. Siblings include brother, sister, stepbrother, and stepsister. Spouses include husband and wife (mistresses and fianc√©s are not counted).\n    *   **`parch`**: The number of parents or children traveling with the passenger. Parents include mother and father. Children include daughter, son, stepdaughter, and stepson. Notably, `parch=0` for children who traveled only with a nanny.\n    The exact amount of data (e.g., number of rows or files) is not specified in the provided notes.\n\n3.  **Evaluation Details**:\n    The specific evaluation metric used to measure success in this competition is not detailed in the provided information.\n\n4.  **Competition Type**:\n    Based on the objective of predicting survival (a binary outcome), this is a **binary classification** competition. The data itself is **structured** and tabular.\n\n5.  **Key Constraints**:\n    Information regarding deadlines, required submission format, or any special competition rules is not available in the provided notes.",
