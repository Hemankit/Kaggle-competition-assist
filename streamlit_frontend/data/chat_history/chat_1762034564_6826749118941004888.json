      "content": "Here are the key facts about this Kaggle competition:\n\n1.  **Core Information:**\n    *   **Competition Focus:** The competition centers on predicting passenger survival during the sinking of the Titanic.\n    *   **Objective:** The primary objective is to predict a binary outcome (0 for deceased, 1 for survived) for each passenger listed in the test set.\n\n2.  **Data Context:**\n    *   **Data Type:** The competition uses structured, tabular data related to Titanic passengers.\n    *   **Files Provided:** Three files are provided: `train.csv`, `test.csv`, and `gender_submission.csv`.\n    *   **Data Split:** The data is divided into a `training set (train.csv)` which includes the `survival` outcome (ground truth) for model building, and a `test set (test.csv)` for which survival predictions must be made.\n    *   **Total Columns:** The dataset contains 25 columns in total.\n    *   **Key Features:** The provided features for prediction include `pclass` (Ticket class), `sex` (Sex), `Age` (Age in years), `sibsp` (# of siblings / spouses aboard), `parch` (# of parents / children aboard), `ticket` (Ticket number), `fare` (Passenger fare), `cabin` (Cabin number), and `embarked` (Port of Embarkation). The target variable is `survival`.\n    *   **Example Submission:** `gender_submission.csv` serves as an example of the required submission file format.\n\n3.  **Evaluation Details:**\n    *   **Metric:** The competition uses **accuracy** as its evaluation metric.\n    *   **Measurement:** Success is measured by the percentage of passengers for whom the survival outcome is correctly predicted.\n\n4.  **Competition Type:**\n    *   This is a **binary classification** competition, as the task involves predicting one of two discrete outcomes (survived or not survived). The data is **structured**.\n\n5.  **Key Constraints:**\n    *   **Submission File Format:** Submissions must be a CSV file.\n    *   **Submission File Content:** The submission file must contain exactly 418 data entries, in addition to a header row.\n    *   **Columns:** It must have exactly two columns: `PassengerId` and `Survived`.\n    *   **'Survived' Column:** The `Survived` column must contain binary predictions (1 for survived, 0 for deceased).\n    *   **'PassengerId' Order:** The `PassengerId` column can be sorted in any order.\n    *   **Error Conditions:** Submissions will result in an error if they include extra columns (beyond `PassengerId` and `Survived`) or extra rows.",

      "content": "Hello! Here is a factual overview of the competition based on the provided information:\n\n### 1. Core Information\nThis competition is about predicting the survival of passengers on the Titanic. The objective is to determine whether a passenger survived (represented by a '1') or did not survive (represented by a '0') the sinking.\n\n### 2. Data Context\nThe data is provided in two main sets:\n*   **`train.csv`**: Used for building machine learning models, this set includes the \"ground truth\" (survival outcome) for each passenger.\n*   **`test.csv`**: Used to evaluate model performance on unseen data. For this set, the survival outcomes are not provided, and participants must predict them.\nAn example submission file, `gender_submission.csv`, is also provided to illustrate the required format.\n\nThe available features for each passenger are:\n*   **`survival`**: The target variable, indicating survival (0 = No, 1 = Yes).\n*   **`pclass`**: Ticket class, serving as a proxy for socio-economic status (1st = Upper, 2nd = Middle, 3rd = Lower).\n*   **`sex`**: Passenger's sex.\n*   **`Age`**: Age in years. Fractional ages (e.g., less than 1) are possible, and estimated ages are noted with `.5`.\n*   **`sibsp`**: Number of siblings or spouses aboard the Titanic. Siblings include brother, sister, stepbrother, stepsister. Spouses include husband, wife.\n*   **`parch`**: Number of parents or children aboard the Titanic. Parents include mother, father. Children include daughter, son, stepdaughter, stepson. A value of `0` indicates children traveling only with a nanny.\n*   **`ticket`**: Ticket number.\n*   **`fare`**: Passenger fare.\n*   **`cabin`**: Cabin number.\n*   **`embarked`**: Port of Embarkation (C = Cherbourg, Q = Queenstown, S = Southampton).\n\n### 3. Evaluation Details\nThe performance of your predictions is measured using **accuracy**. Your score will be the percentage of passengers for whom you correctly predict the survival outcome.\n\n### 4. Competition Type\nThis is a **binary classification** competition, as the task is to predict one of two discrete outcomes (survived or not survived). The data provided is **structured** (tabular).\n\n### 5. Key Constraints\n*   **Submission File Format**: Submissions must be a CSV file.\n*   **File Content**: The submission file must contain exactly 418 entries plus a header row.\n*   **Columns**: It must have exactly two columns: `PassengerId` (which can be sorted in any order) and `Survived` (containing your binary predictions: 1 for survived, 0 for deceased).\n*   **Errors**: Submissions with extra columns (beyond `PassengerId` and `Survived`) or extra rows will result in an error.\n*   **Example**: An example submission file (`gender_submission.csv`) is available for download on the Data page.",
